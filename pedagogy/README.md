|Sr. No. |Learning Objective |Cognitive Level |Action Verb|
|--------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|
|1.|	Students will be able to select NAND/NOR gate option for the design.|	Recall	|Select
|2.|	Students will be able to recall the truth table of NAND/NOR gates.|	Recall	|Recall
|3.	|The student will be able to select NAND/NOR gates for 1:2 design.	|Apply|	Select
|4.|	The student will be able to construct 1:2 decoder/demux by making appropriate connections between NAND/NOR gates.	|Apply	|Construct
|5.|	The student will be able to compare the simulation output and the function table.	|Analyze|	Compare

## 2.1. Instructional Strategy : Problem Based
### 2.2. Assessment Method : Formative Assessment
